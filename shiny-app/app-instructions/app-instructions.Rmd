## anem Web app -- Beta version

This shiny application is currently in development. It functions when used according to the following instructions.

1. Define aquifer
    + *Define boundaries*. The aquifer boundary serves as the domain boundary. With the approach used in this app, the aquifer **must** be rectangular. Define boundaries by clicking 4 points on the map, and the app will "rectangularize" the boundaries.
    + *Define properties*. 
1. Define wells
    + *Set properties of new wells*:
        + Pumping rate, Q: specified as cubic meters per second. It should be negative for pumping (abstraction), and positive for injection.
        + Well diameter, diam (m): Diameter of the well.
        + Group and Weight are not currently used.
        + The radius of influence should be calculated.
    + *Add wells.* Click within the aquifer to add wells.
    + *Edit wells.* Any well property can be edited in the table.
        + Clicking a well highlights that well within the table, and allows that well to be deleted.
1. View results
    + *Edit pumping.* You can edit the pumping rates of each well to see how head within the aquifer and at each well changes.
